        <h2>Description</h2>
        <!--Broken down the paragraph to be human-readable-->
        <p>
            An easy chicken breast recipe made with few ingredients. 
            I use this as a basic baked chicken recipe when another 
            recipe calls for cooked chicken. It works great for 
            everything and is super customizable. Sometimes I use 
            garlic salt or other seasonings, depending on what I'm 
            using it for.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Â¼ cup butter, melter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients. 
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Lightly butter a baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>Stir together melted butter and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>
                Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish. 
                Brush butter mixture onto chicken until thoroughly coated, 
                pouring any extra over chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink 
                in the center and juices run clear, 30 to 45 minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
                should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
